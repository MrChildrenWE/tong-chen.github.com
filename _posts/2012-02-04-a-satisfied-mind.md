A Satisfied Mind

&nbsp;

Bob Dylan

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

How many times have you heard someone say  
If I had his money I&#8217;d do things my way  
Hmm, but little they know  
Hmm, it&#8217;s so hard to find  
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.

Hmm, once I was wadding in fortune and fame  
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game  
But suddenly it happened  
Hmm, I lost every dime  
But I&#8217;m richer by far with a satisfied mind.

Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out  
My friends and my love ones  
I&#8217;ll leave there ain&#8217;t no doubt  
But one thing for certain  
When it comes my time  
I&#8217;ll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
