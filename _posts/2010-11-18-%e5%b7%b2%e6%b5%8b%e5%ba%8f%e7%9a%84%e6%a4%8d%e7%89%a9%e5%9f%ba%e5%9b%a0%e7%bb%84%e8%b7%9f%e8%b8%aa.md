This site attempts to track all plant genomes with published sequences, and at least some of the genomes currently in the process of being sequenced. Genomes are divided into four states:

* Published: A complete genome sequence is available, and anyone can publish papers on it without restriction.  
* Unpublished: The complete sequence (or a substantially complete sequence) is available, but whole genome analysis cannot be published until the group that sequenced the genome publishes their own paper describing it. These restrictions are outlines by the Fort Lauderdale Convention.  
* Incomplete: A partial assembly is available, but sequencing and/or assembly and/or gene annotation is ongoing.  
* Unreleased: Genome sequencing has at least begun, but no data has been made publicly available.
