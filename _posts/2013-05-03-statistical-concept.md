1.Correlation coefficient and R-square

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">R is used to determine whether the relationship is positive or 
    negative based upon the sign of R.

R^2 is the predictive percent of behavior in the output that 
    can be explained by the input.

R^2 &lt;30% are considered to have no correlation and behavior is 
    explained by chance

R^2 of 30% to 49.99% are considered to be a mild relationsip

R^2 of 50% to 69.99% are considered to be a moderate relationship

R^2 of 70% to 100% are considered to be a strong relationship
