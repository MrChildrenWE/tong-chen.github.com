    MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in practically all cell biological processes by virtue of their role in regulating gene expression through translational repression and mRNA decay. Two studies now examine the kinetics of this process and find that miRNAs first block translation of their mRNA target and then mediate its decay.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To determine the kinetics of miRNA-mediated gene silencing, Bazzini et al. used zebrafish embryos, which express miR-430 4 hours post-fertilization to clear maternal mRNAs. <strong>They found that the number of ribosomes bound to miR-430 targets significantly decreased 4 hours post-fertilization in wild-type embryos but not in mutants lacking Dicer</strong> (which is required for miRNA biogenesis). This finding was indicative of miRNA-mediated translational repression. By contrast, target mRNA levels did not change until 6 hours post-fertilization, which suggests that translational repression occurs before mRNA decay.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Djuranovic et al. approached the same question using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells transfected with constructs carrying 3′ untranslated regions with miRNA target sites and a luciferase reporter gene fused to the 5′ end. By examining the levels of luciferase (which are indicative of protein expression) and the levels of reporter mRNAs, the authors observed that translation repression occurred at least 2 hours before mRNA decay, which is consistent with the results of Bazzini et al.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    mRNA decay requires the removal of the stabilizing poly(A) tail, which is a process that has also been proposed to have a role in <strong>miRNA-mediated translation repression.</strong> However, Bazzini et al. observed complete mRNA deadenylation only at 6 hours post-fertilization, after translation repression had begun. Moreover, a transcript in which deadenylation had been delayed showed comparable translational repression to a control transcript. Similarly, Djuranovic et al. did not observe any shortening of the poly(A) tail length in miRNA target transcripts during translation repression. Thus, inhibition of protein synthesis seems to occur before deadenylation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But which stage of translation do miRNAs specifically target? To answer this question, Bazzini et al. examined the distribution of ribosomes along the transcript. They observed that ribosomes were <strong>uniformly distributed but showed low occupancy on the repressed transcript, which is indicative of decreased translation initiation, rather than a block in elongation or premature termination.</strong> Djuranovic et al. used a different approach: assaying the cleavage of mRNAs that occurs when ribosomes stall during elongation. They found that control mRNAs (those not targeted by the tested miRNAs) were cleaved and degraded, whereas target mRNAs were stable, which indicates that target mRNAs had not progressed to elongation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Together, these studies reveal the kinetics of miRNA gene silencing, corroborating previous in vitro results. As the findings were consistent in zebrafish and<br /> D. melanogaster, it is likely that the kinetics also apply to other systems.
