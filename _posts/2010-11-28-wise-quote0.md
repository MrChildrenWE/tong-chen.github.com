If you** judge** people, you have no time to** love** them.

Mother Teresa

Birds sing after a storm; **why shouldn&#8217;t people feel as free to delight in whatever remains to them?**

Who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air, is not **worth all** the suffering and effort which life implies.

Erich Fromm

The** sun shines and warms and lights us **and we have no curiosity to know why this is so; but we ask the reason of all evil, of pain, and hunger, and mosquitoes and silly people.

Ralph Waldo Emerson
