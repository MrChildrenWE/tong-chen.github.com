<span style="color: #000000;">looks like we made it</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">there you are<br /> lookin&#8217; just the same as you did,<br /> last time i touched you<br /> and, here i am<br /> close to gettin&#8217; tangled up<br /> inside the thought of you</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">do you love him<br /> as much as i love her<br /> and will that love be strong<br /> when old feelings start to stir</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">looks like we made it<br /> left each other on the way,<br /> to another love<br /> looks</span> <span style="color: #000000;"> like we made it<br /> or i thought so, till today<br /> until you were there everywhere<br /> and all i could taste was love<br /> the way we made it</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">love&#8217;s so strange<br /> playin&#8217; hide and seek, with hearts<br /> and always hurtin&#8217;<br /> and we&#8217;re the fools<br /> standin&#8217; close enough to touch<br /> those burnin&#8217; memories</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">and if i hold you<br /> for the sake of all those times<br /> love made us lose our minds<br /> could i ever let you go</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">oh, no&#8230;we made it<br /> left each other, on the way<br /> to another love<br /> looks</span> <span style="color: #000000;"> like we made it<br /> or i thought so, till today<br /> until you were there<br /> everywhere<br /> and all i could taste was love<br /> the way we made it<br /> looks</span> <span style="color: #000000;"> like we made it<br /> left each other on the way,<br /> to another love<br /> looks</span> <span style="color: #000000;"> like we made it<br /> or i thought so, till today<br /> until you were there everywhere<br /> and all i could taste was love<br /> the way we made it<br /> looks</span> <span style="color: #000000;"> like we made it</span>
