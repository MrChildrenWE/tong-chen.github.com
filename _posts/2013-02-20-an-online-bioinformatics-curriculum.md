  <p>
    <a id="article1.front1.article-meta1.abstract1.p1" name="article1.front1.article-meta1.abstract1.p1"></a>Online learning initiatives over the past decade have become increasingly comprehensive in their selection of courses and sophisticated in their presentation, culminating in the recent announcement of a number of consortium and startup activities that promise to make a university education on the internet, free of charge, a real possibility. At this pivotal moment it is appropriate to explore the potential for obtaining comprehensive bioinformatics training with currently existing free video resources. This article presents such a bioinformatics curriculum in the form of a virtual course catalog, together with editorial commentary, and an assessment of strengths, weaknesses, and likely future directions for open online learning in this field.

    Online Learning Comes of Age
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec1.p1" name="article1.body1.sec1.p1"></a>Online academic “courseware” at the university level has now been available to the public for a decade, the earliest concerted effort having originated in 2002 with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and their OpenCourseWare initiative (<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">http://ocw.mit.edu</a>). This project offered up the syllabi, lecture notes, quizzes, exams, and/or other study materials for a very large number of courses, at the discretion of professors but with strong support and encouragement from the MIT administration. Only in a minority of cases were videos of lectures posted.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec1.p2" name="article1.body1.sec1.p2"></a>Even before this, The University of California, Berkeley, had started webcasting lectures, and eventually began posting both audio and video for public consumption at their Berkeley Webcast site (<a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/">http://webcast.berkeley.edu</a>), though without the ancillary materials of MIT&#8217;s OpenCourseWare. A number of other universities followed suit, though seldom so extensively; among these was Stanford with its ClassX streaming service (<a href="http://classx.stanford.edu/ClassX">http://classx.stanford.edu/ClassX</a>) and an earlier effort called Stanford Engineering Everywhere (<a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx">http://see.stanford.edu/see/courses.aspx</a>). In many cases, individual faculty members took the initiative to post course materials, including video, in widely varying formats. Some adopted the use of “Khan-style videos” or tablet-based screencasts of the sort popularized by the Kahn Academy with its vast library of instructional videos, which started as a viral YouTube sensation and has now become its own well-funded institution (<a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">http://www.khanacademy.org</a>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec1.p3" name="article1.body1.sec1.p3"></a>YouTube indeed became the destination of many academic videos, which are now aggregated by institution under YouTube EDU (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/education">http://www.youtube.com/education</a>). Apple has also put its distinctive stamp on online learning with iTunes U (<a href="http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u">http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u</a>), also organized by institution but with integrated search capability and, of course, deployment to iPad and iPhone apps. Countless aggregators also assemble collections of video courses, but generally with little value added.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec1.p4" name="article1.body1.sec1.p4"></a>Yale University began in 2007 to release Open Yale Courses (<a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/">http://oyc.yale.edu</a>) in a more curated and consistent format than most other efforts, including high-quality video and extensive syllabi; courses appeared incrementally, with just under 50 available to date. Then, in 2011, MIT revamped several of its online courses into a much more structured instructional format, with learning modules in outline form containing videos interspersed with self-assessment and other activities. In a somewhat different vein, the non-profit Saylor Foundation compiled a comprehensive online university curriculum comprising courses that are essentially mashups of video and text resources from many existing sources, including a number of those described above (<a href="http://www.saylor.org/">http://www.saylor.org</a>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec1.p5" name="article1.body1.sec1.p5"></a>In the fall of 2011, a highly publicized online course, “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence” (AI), was conducted by Stanford University Prof. Sebastian Thrun and Google&#8217;s Director of Research, Peter Norvig, based on the Stanford AI course. It ran “live” in the sense that new videos were released and homework assignments collected on a weekly basis, and quizzes and exams were given at set times, while discussion logs allowed for some degree of interaction. The course attracted 160,000 students from 190 countries, 22,000 of whom finished successfully and were granted “certificates of completion” <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002632#pcbi.1002632-Markoff1">[1]</a>. Shortly afterwards, MIT set up a similar approach on a new platform called MITx, offering a course in electronic circuits that attracted comparable numbers of students (<a href="https://6002x.mitx.mit.edu/">https://6002x.mitx.mit.edu</a>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec1.p6" name="article1.body1.sec1.p6"></a>The trend to structured presentation and high production quality then accelerated remarkably, and took an entrepreneurial turn. The AI course was effectively spun off by Prof. Thrun into a Web startup called Udacity (<a href="http://www.udacity.com/">http://www.udacity.com</a>), which is currently live with six courses. In April of 2012, two other Stanford scientists, Profs. Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, announced a similar newco called Coursera (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/">https://www.coursera.org</a>), with backing from major Silicon Valley venture capital firms. Coursera, also now live, is being stocked with courses from academic partners Stanford, Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Michigan; this list was recently augmented with a tranche of a dozen more top-tier universities. And in May of 2012, barely six months after MIT had rolled out its new MITx platform, they and Harvard announced that the institutions were investing $30 million each in a joint online learning initiative called edX (<a href="http://www.edxonline.org/">http://www.edxonline.org</a>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec1.p7" name="article1.body1.sec1.p7"></a>All of these initiatives promise to offer undiluted, highly interactive university-level courses to the public, free of charge. Moreover, there is every indication that the instruction can be effective; the U.S. Department of Education, in an exhaustive meta-analysis of 51 published head-to-head trials, found that “on average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction” <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002632#pcbi.1002632-Means1">[2]</a>.

<div id="section2">
  <a id="s2" title="An Online Bioinformatics Education" name="s2"></a></p> <h3>
    An Online Bioinformatics Education
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec2.p1" name="article1.body1.sec2.p1"></a>Clearly a revolution in open online learning is at hand. This is a welcome addition to a movement that also encompasses open online scientific publication, of which this journal is an example. As such, this is an appropriate forum to assess the current potential for a freely accessible online bioinformatics education.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec2.p2" name="article1.body1.sec2.p2"></a>Both the completeness and the quality of such an unconventional education should be evaluated. Such judgments cannot be entirely objective, and even curricula in conventional university settings vary widely. Thus, this must ultimately be considered an “opinion piece.” Even its purely factual content has to be viewed as evanescent, given the rate of change in online education, and the fact that newly announced initiatives may increase the selection and quality of courses available to a considerable extent even within the year.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec2.p3" name="article1.body1.sec2.p3"></a>Even so, the first opinion offered here is that it is probably already possible for a motivated student to become a competent, employable bioinformatics professional in the comfort of his or her own home—with certain important caveats to be elaborated in the discussion at the end. By way of evidence, a suggested curriculum will be laid out that is supported by existing online resources.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec2.p4" name="article1.body1.sec2.p4"></a>This central thesis, that online bioinformatics education has in some sense “arrived,” can certainly be challenged on a number of counts. The fundamental question of the optimal content for bioinformatics training would probably elude universal consensus in any case, and perhaps the most that can be hoped for is that what follows will contribute meaningfully to the dialogue. Even so, the reader has a right to question both the author&#8217;s qualifications and methodology in offering these opinions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec2.p5" name="article1.body1.sec2.p5"></a>The author has advanced degrees in both biology and computer science, has published original research in both fields, and has passing familiarity with but is by no means expert in all of the advanced course topics described below. He has helped design academic curricula as part of a major training grant and taught at both an undergraduate and graduate level, though not extensively, having spent most of his career in the computer and then the pharmaceutical industries. However, in the latter positions he was directly or indirectly responsible for hiring well over a hundred scientists and engineers for bioinformatics-related roles. Thus if any bias exists, it is probably in favor of the practical over the theoretical, though the author&#8217;s own research is somewhat more in the latter category.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec2.p6" name="article1.body1.sec2.p6"></a>In terms of methodology, the author has personally sampled all of the main courses listed below that are currently available, as well as most of those offered as alternatives or suggested for advanced study. Of these, he has actually completed six of the main courses and seven in the latter categories (most recently, two of the inaugural offerings by Coursera), and has made significant progress in several more. In each case the main course offering for a given topic was adjudged superior to the alternatives based on a variety of criteria including coverage, production quality, availability of ancillary course material, and incorporation of the latest modular courseware technologies described above. Less tangible factors such as teaching style, clarity, and pace were also considered. Courses listed as alternatives to the main courses still met basic standards of quality, and in addition to offering redundancy often had other features that might appeal to specific students, for instance in terms of areas of emphasis. In several cases, courses were selected as main offerings despite being scheduled but not yet online; such judgments were made based on instructors&#8217; proven teaching backgrounds and in some instances after direct consultation with them on the syllabi.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec2.p7" name="article1.body1.sec2.p7"></a>Only courses offered without charge were considered. Online courses and entire degree programs for money are widely available, though troubling to some given issues of accreditation and mounting student debt. Course discussion logs on free resources like Coursera indicate a tremendous demand for online education in the developing world, and students anywhere may need to be thrifty, particularly if they are retraining or exploring career change. There are certainly extension programs of universities and other for-profit resources that offer good value-for-money in this arena, and those who can afford it should not be discouraged from taking advantage of such benefits as personalized instruction. Nevertheless, part of the challenge in the present instance is to see just how far the free resources have come. Moreover there is the practical issue that extending the analysis to paid courses would open up a much larger set of alternatives, most of which are inaccessible to evaluation without expenditure.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec2.p8" name="article1.body1.sec2.p8"></a>Only video courses are included, either showing the instructor with slides and/or blackboard, or in screencast format. Learning from course notes only, or even disembodied audio, simply doesn&#8217;t have the immediacy of the visual experience of a lecture hall or even a tablet-based screencast. At the other extreme, one could maintain that reading textbooks at one&#8217;s own speed is a more efficient and focused way to learn. That is certainly true for some, and perhaps more so for experienced and mature scholars, but it is probably also true that a lecture format offers much-needed structure to the learning process for others. Moreover, cognitive psychology offers both a theoretical basis and empirical evidence for the benefits of multimedia learning <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002632#pcbi.1002632-Mayer1">[3]</a>. In any case, most of the courses below require reading at least selections from one or more textbooks in close coordination with the lectures (though in a surprising number of cases the textbooks are freely available online).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec2.p9" name="article1.body1.sec2.p9"></a>What follows, then, is a virtual catalog for a course of study in bioinformatics. It includes both core courses and electives, as will be evident in the commentaries included with each course. Even at that, different paths are possible depending on preparation (whether the student starts with a biology and/or computer science background already) and inclination (whether the student plans to focus on bioinformatics analysis and needs less programming experience, or hopes to develop algorithms and systems that require considerably more computational sophistication). Since this virtual program awards no degrees and makes no guarantees, it will not attempt to set absolute standards for numbers of credits and distribution of core and elective subjects, but will suggest possible study threads in the penultimate section of this article.

With this video course we introduce a resource developed by the Indian National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL), whose ambition is “to build at least one version of each course offered in all of Science and Engineering in India, from BTech/BSc to PhD programs” (<a href="http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/">http://nptel.iitm.ac.in</a>). It currently offers some 110 full video courses, skewed toward engineering, but with plans for up to 400 total. The courses tend to follow very traditional syllabi and sometimes move slowly, but are generally well produced and exhaustive in their coverage. The lectures are delivered in English that is more or less accented but nearly always impeccable, and altogether make for a rather refreshing multicultural experience.

    <a id="article1.body1.sec3.sec4.sec7.p1" name="article1.body1.sec3.sec4.sec7.p1"></a>This pair of courses together provide in-depth coverage of classical genetics through modern genomics of the non-human variety. The first course, entitled “Plant Molecular Genetics,” actually begins with a comprehensive introduction to general Mendelian genetics, before delving into plant genetics in detail. The student may wish to skip some of the latter lectures, but they do cover many aspects of molecular genetics that are completely general. The second entry, “Microbial Genetics and Genomics,” starts halfway through the actual course with the lectures of Prof. Glass, focusing on comparative genomics, and includes an extended exercise in annotation of a new microbial genome from the Joint Genome Institute. Finally, for some exposure to current human genetics, the student should take the “Genetics for Epidemiologists” short course conducted by the National Human Genome Research Institute in 2008 (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6D747D95EBB33F2D">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6​D747D95EBB33F2D</a>). While this pastiche of sources may not be ideal, it touches on the major themes in this diverse subject and will give a good sense of the tools underlying many laboratory methods used in molecular biology.

The first third (taught by Prof. Alber) covers DNA replication and repair, the second third (Prof. Zhou) does RNA and protein synthesis, and the final third (Prof. Zhong) includes cell membranes, membrane proteins, trafficking, signaling, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Note that there are some missing lectures in the first third of the Fall 2009 version, but the student can use the Fall 2008 version for Prof. Alber&#8217;s lectures (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/molecular-cell-biology-110/id354820355">http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/molecul​ar-cell-biology-110/id354820355</a>), which, however, is missing the final third of the course. Note that in all cases iTunes has the order of courses reversed in its listing. (An iTunes link is provided rather than a Berkeley Webcast link because a significant number of courses were dropped from the latter website during a redesign in 2011.)

Berkeley does not allow this course and the previous one to be taken together for elective credit, but the overlap is mainly with the last third of the Molecular Biology course, so students may want to take only the first two thirds of that course and then this course in its entirety.

This course provides a biologist&#8217;s approach to computational biology, and is thus listed separately from a corresponding course in the Computer Science Department. The emphasis here is more on how to use the algorithms than on the details of their construction.

Next we introduce principles of genetics and then apply them in clinical genetics and other large-scale sequencing projects. In the functional genomics unit, we start with RNA expression dynamics, analysis of alternative splicing, epigenomics and ChIP-seq, and metagenomics. Model organisms and forward and reverse genetics screens are then discussed, along with quantitative trait locus (QTL) and eQTL analysis.

An important side benefit of learning the scientific content itself is the educational experience of becoming familiar with the names, faces, and presentation techniques of many of the top scientists in the American biological community.

Not only are differential equations a mainstay of mathematical biology in areas such as enzyme kinetics and population dynamics, but they are the basis of many approaches to modeling of biological systems. Prof. Mattuck&#8217;s development of the subject is fairly traditional, but is supplemented by updated “wrappers” in the MIT courseware that provide helpful visualizations and simulations of the sort to which many modern treatments of the subject are trending.

While math packages can handle much of the dirty work, the real pros need to understand what&#8217;s under the hood. While Prof. Kaw&#8217;s course at the University of South Florida is listed here, this link is actually for an independent e-learning course funded by major grants to Prof. Kaw from the U.S. National Science Foundation and used by a variety of universities.

An associated textbook is also freely available online, a chapter at a time <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002632#pcbi.1002632-Kaw1">[8]</a>.

He has long held that the subject of linear algebra should be given as much or more teaching emphasis than calculus and differential equations, and the rise of Big Data is now proving him correct beyond any doubt. No bioinformatics professional dealing with high-dimensional data can afford to neglect an understanding of matrix math, with many bioinformatics methods currently making use of various matrix factorizations, transformations, decompositions, and eigenwhatevers.

    <a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec6.sec5.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec6.sec5.p1"></a>Despite the name, this course also extends to formal language theory and introduces tractability. The primary attraction of this Coursera offering is its illustrious instructor, who literally wrote the book on automata (and on databases, on algorithms, etc.). It&#8217;s hard to imagine a better way for biologists to be introduced to the theory of computation. Topics such as automata and grammars are important in areas like pattern matching and RNA fold prediction, while an awareness of tractability and decidability is essential in contemplating algorithmic approaches to new problems. Perhaps most importantly, as Prof. Ullman points out, surveys of Stanford grads show that this course was one of the most useful in their subsequent careers, for the mindset it engendered in solving many real-world computational challenges.

    <a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec7.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec7.sec4.p1"></a>Discrete math provides much of the theoretical foundation for computer science. At its more rarefied levels it must be considered an elective for the purposes of bioinformatics. Nevertheless it is important in the analysis of algorithms and even certain aspects of biology, and for those with ambitions to speak at RECOMB or publish in the <em>Journal of Computational Biology</em>, this sort of course is a necessary first step. The video is of marginal quality, displaying old-fashioned hand-written transparencies, so the student may wish to consider the alternatives below, but this course has the considerable advantage of closely following the truly gem-like textbook “Concrete Mathematics” by U.C. San Diego&#8217;s Prof. Ronald Graham, Stanford&#8217;s Prof. Donald Knuth and Oren Patashnik <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002632#pcbi.1002632-Graham1">[18]</a>.

However, in addition to doing the online course&#8217;s optional programming assignments (in R or NetLogo) the more advanced student can and should make use of the rich array of slides, tutorials, demonstrations, and sample data in the original course posting, thus using the videos as a framework to explore the course materials in greater depth. For purposes of bioinformatics, students should also take the online tutorials associated with the ubiquitous Cytoscape platform (<a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">http://www.cytoscape.org</a>), and apply the learnings from the course itself to biological datasets wherever possible.

    <a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec12.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec12.sec4.p1"></a>It goes without saying that much of molecular biology deals with the storage and transmission of information, which by itself makes information theory a proper topic of study for bioinformatics. Basic elements of the theory are important in machine learning approaches to data mining and appear frequently in bioinformatics tools and algorithms, including sequence motif analysis and many other applications. However, the mathematical depth of this course will only be necessary for serious theorists. The late Prof. Cover was the author of the standard textbook in the field <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002632#pcbi.1002632-Cover1">[27]</a>.

    <a id="article1.body1.sec4.sec13.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec4.sec13.sec4.p1"></a>Traditional engineering approaches to signal processing and linear systems theory have not had a huge impact in bioinformatics to date, despite the fact that signal transduction and transmission are central aspects of cell biology. Still, some training in the engineering math that relates to feedback systems, filters, convolution, and the like is recommended as an elective, given trends in areas like systems biology and neuroinformatics. Nor should it be forgotten that Fourier analysis is at the foundation of crystallographic structure determination, and that signal processing is directly relevant to instrumentation used in omics and image processing, among other things. Although this course was recorded a quarter-century ago, it still feels very well put-together, and the eminent Prof. Oppenheim wrote the definitive text in the subject <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002632#pcbi.1002632-Oppenheim1">[30]</a>.

    <a id="article1.body1.sec5.sec1.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec5.sec1.sec4.p1"></a>For biologists possessing only end-user experience with computers, several courses are available that offer a modest introduction to actual programming, generally in the context of an overview of computer science. This one is chosen somewhat arbitrarily, but in particular because it makes use of Python. While opinions about languages vary, a case can be made that Python is both well accepted in the bioinformatics community and pedagogically useful in encompassing many features (perhaps even too many) of object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming, in addition to ample libraries and bindings to other languages and resources. It is also a good compromise between a traditional Java or C++ language approach, which only serious bioinformatics developers will need, and the sort of lightweight scripting for string, file, and process manipulation (think Perl) that every analyst will do sooner or later. In addition, Python is simply easier to manage on a home laptop, a requirement for many online learners.

    <a id="article1.body1.sec5.sec6.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec5.sec6.sec4.p1"></a>Programming is one thing, software engineering is quite another. Bioinformatics applications are increasingly yielding to bioinformatics systems, thus the need for practitioners hoping to do significant development to study this topic in depth. The provider description is taken from the Berkeley course catalog, but in fact the instructors have lately been morphing the course toward an agile development approach to Software as a Service (SaaS) using Ruby on Rails for Cloud deployment. In other words, they are hitting many themes that are important to recent bioinformatics trends. A version of this course is also on Coursera (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/saas">https://www.coursera.org/course/saas</a>).

    <a id="article1.body1.sec5.sec13.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec5.sec13.sec4.p1"></a>Bioinformatics has a long tradition relating it to artificial intelligence (AI), including the origins of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference series. Besides introducing machine learning, which should be pursued further in the next course listed, this course introduces knowledge representation, important as a foundation for biological ontologies; Bayesian nets, useful in biological network causal analysis; and natural language understanding, which is highly relevant to biomedical text mining. The course uses Python, and refers to but does not require the very popular text by Berkeley Prof. Stuart Russell and Google&#8217;s Peter Norvig, “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach” <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002632#pcbi.1002632-Russell1">[38]</a>.

A very popular albeit advanced text, “Elements of Statistical Learning” by Stanford Profs.

Students should obtain and become proficient in machine learning tools, which can be done from R or Octave (as a free alternative to MatLab) environments (see above). A friendlier user environment is provided by tools like Weka (<a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka">http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka</a>), widely used in teaching, or Orange, which has add-ons for bioinformatics and text mining (<a href="http://orange.biolab.si/">http://orange.biolab.si</a>); both are open source. Python also has resources in this arena, for example the PyML machine learning framework (<a href="http://pyml.sourceforge.net/">http://pyml.sourceforge.net</a>). For bioinformatics, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are terrifically important (not just for sequence profiles, but also Copy Number Variation discovery, Single Nucleotide Polymorphism genotyping, gene prediction, etc.). HMMs are not covered in the core courses above (though they are introduced in the course below), nor are there the same sort of user-friendly environments for HMMs, but there are toolkits that the bioinformatics student can use to study the associated algorithms, such as HMMoC (<a href="http://biowiki.org/HMMoC">http://biowiki.org/HMMoC</a>) or HMMConverter (<a href="http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~irmtraud/hmmconverter">http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~irmtraud/hmmcon​verter</a>), as well as R packages. Stanford Prof. Daphne Koller, the other academic co-founder of Coursera, is offering a course on “Probabilistic Graphical Models,” another important flavor of machine learning that includes Bayesian nets and Markov random fields, which already have had significant impact in network bioinformatics (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm">https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm</a>).

    <a id="article1.body1.sec6.sec4.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec6.sec4.sec4.p1"></a>Game theory has long been used in the study of evolutionary dynamics, an increasingly important field, and backward induction is a generalization of the same sort of dynamic programming used in biological sequence analysis, applied to such problems as choosing optimal strategies in sports. Game theory also bears on modeling and network theory. Scientists in any quantitative field probably ought to be familiar with such basic ideas as the prisoners&#8217; dilemma, Pareto optimality, and Nash equilibria, or indeed with any field that has produced eight Nobel prizes. The subject tends to be taught in economics departments, which makes for an interesting change of perspective, and also provides a link to the fascinating new field of neuroeconomics.

  <p>
    <a id="article1.body1.sec6.sec5.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec6.sec5.sec4.p1"></a>Many students who learn bioinformatics will be exposed to the very latest advances in both biotechnology and computing, probably the two fields that result in the greatest rate of business startups, especially from academic spinoffs. Thus learning entrepreneurship skills is entirely appropriate as an elective in this curriculum. The STVP is housed in Stanford Engineering and hosted by the department of Management Science and Engineering. The web site has hundreds of videos, including seminars, case studies, and tutorials, many by Silicon Valley luminaries. As a way of organizing the student&#8217;s approach to this cornucopia, two collections in particular are recommended: “Invitation to Venture” (<a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/collections.html?collectionId=1">http://ecorner.stanford.edu/collections.​html?collectionId=1</a>) as an introduction, and then “Technology Ventures” (<a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/collections.html?collectionId=2">http://ecorner.stanford.edu/collections.​html?collectionId=2</a>) as a more directed approach of relevance to bioinformatics.

    <a id="article1.body1.sec6.sec6.sec4.p1" name="article1.body1.sec6.sec6.sec4.p1"></a>At the inception of the Genome Project significant emphasis was placed on “ELSI” or ethical, legal, and social implications, and these are even more prominent today in such issues as personal data privacy, bioethics in human and animal experimentation, and the like. Biologists nowadays often have some training in bioethics but for computer scientists it may be more novel, yet increasingly important given new capacities for mining Big Data. This is a relatively short and very general introduction to ethics, but one that is highly intellectually stimulating—so much so that it fills a large theatre whenever it is presented at Harvard by Prof. Sandel, with production values worthy of a one-man show on Broadway. You are likely to discover useful things about yourself, for example, whether you are a deontologist or a consequentialist (which, for you computer types, has something to do with whether your moral judgments are determined at compile-time or run-time).

    <a id="article1.body1.sec7.p1" name="article1.body1.sec7.p1"></a>As noted at the outset, students will come to online learning from different backgrounds and with different goals in mind, and moreover will have different amounts of time to devote to the process. Therefore it is not helpful to be overly prescriptive about course selection. However, it is possible to identify some basic “types” of bioinformatics practitioners, and to suggest possible course selections best suited to those career paths. It should be emphasized that different institutions and individuals may have other views on bioinformatics curricula, disagreeing on appropriate electives and even on core courses. To this, the author can only plead editorial privilege, and remind the reader that these are opinions based on one person&#8217;s experience in the field. It would be prudent for potential students to seek a variety of opinions.

Core courses are those deemed central to the track, and should be taken if the material has not already been mastered elsewhere. Electives are at the option of the student, but certain of these are indicated as recommended, and several at least should be taken as time permits. Finally, for some tracks, additional study is recommended to extend certain course topics (denoted by plus signs), as discussed below under Independent Study.

Certainly the curriculum above is constrained by the available online courses, as discussed below in the conclusion. In addition the patchwork nature of the courses, arising as they do from many institutions, can be a strength but also a weakness, with less opportunity for coordination and seamless sequencing of course contents. As in academia, any gaps can be addressed, or special interests accommodated, by independent study. The major disadvantage is the lack of a faculty mentor, which requires students to be proactive, self-sufficient, and conscientious in discerning the needs and means for supplementing their coursework. Perhaps the best way to approach this is for students to make a habit of reading the key journals in their field so as to discover systematic gaps in their knowledge.
                                                                          </p>
                                                                          
                                                                          <p>

Some suggestions for individual tracks are indicated by plus signs in <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002632#pcbi-1002632-t001">Tables 1</a>–<a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002632#pcbi-1002632-t004">4</a>. A plus to the right of a course symbol (whether prerequisite or core) indicates that advanced work in the topic area of that course is recommended for students in that track. Often some specific suggestions for additional study are indicated in the “Going Further” sections of the course catalog, but where specialized courses are not to be found online (as is likely), one hopes that the basic course has provided sufficient background for the student to learn by self-study of more advanced texts and journals.
                                                                          </p>

Ideally this would include exposure to laboratory science, which of course is unlikely in the case of online learners. However, it is expected that many individuals embarking on this track would already be degreed biologists who are seeking additional training to do advanced analyses with their own data or that of others. To some degree the same may be true of the Data Mining track, though these individuals are probably more likely to be committed to a career in exclusively “dry” biology.

These individuals would be well advised to take on substantial projects in the biological domain that go beyond the requirements of the courses taken.
                                                                          </p>

The curriculum offered here is slanted toward systems biology in this regard, but individuals may prefer to study topics such as evolutionary dynamics or mathematical genetics that would require additional study.

Without a doubt there are gaps, and quality is not uniform. For instance, there are few suitable resources in important areas such as neuroscience and structural biology, and several other areas are thin. But the offerings are only getting better and more numerous, and so any imperfections in the current collection should be increasingly easy to correct with the passage of time. A more pertinent question is whether an online education is an adequate substitute for what is termed a resident education, in general and in the particular case of bioinformatics.
                                                                            </p>

Students must be committed to doing assigned readings, exercises and assessments faithfully to achieve maximum uptake, the more so for being on their own.

One great risk to the proposition of online bioinformatics education is that students never really get to grips with applying newfound computational or analytic skills to real biological data and actual problems in the full context of the scientific establishment. To be sure, biological databases are readily accessible and datasets may be found online that can serve as challenge problems for classification, and so forth. But that is not the same as the interactive process of designing a novel experimental program, acquiring data direct from instrumentation, cleaning and reducing it, and taking responsibility for storing it in both persistent and queryable form. Nor does classroom learning by itself, virtual or otherwise, fully prepare one for establishing real-world error models, dealing with missing data, establishing a statistical case for some result, arguing and defending scientific positions, navigating the publication process, and sundry other practical skills.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            
                                                                            <p>
                                                                              <a id="article1.body1.sec8.p4" name="article1.body1.sec8.p4"></a>Thus, a useful adjunct to online learning in bioinformatics might be a portfolio of suggested projects based on real-world datasets that would help exercise the skills of trainees, perhaps in the context of an online community of peers. One can even imagine a future in which the use of virtual laboratories makes it possible for students to undertake mixed wet/dry studies of their own. Just as the Amazon Cloud now makes large-scale computing accessible and economically feasible without the support of a large institutional data center, the decreasing cost of sequencing technology and the synthetic biology movement are both suggestive of the possibility of analogous sorts of remote biology. Educational grants for the creation of virtual laboratories to enrich the online learning experience might be public (or philanthropic) money well spent.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            
                                                                            <p>
                                                                              <a id="article1.body1.sec8.p5" name="article1.body1.sec8.p5"></a>Any amount of study in any context cannot substitute for immersion in the social context of science. In an online learning environment, direct interaction with peers is certainly possible after a fashion, through discussion logs and the like, but to date hasn&#8217;t addressed such important educational elements as the development of public speaking skills. Perhaps the last great barrier to self-learning is the absence of an advisor, with all that implies, and of membership in a working lab. Even the most imaginative web technology will only go so far in this regard, and probably not far enough in the case of wet biology. However, the field of bioinformatics by its nature may offer the best chance for finding ways to involve distance learners directly in ongoing scientific research, and that would seem to be a worthy goal for the burgeoning online education movement.
