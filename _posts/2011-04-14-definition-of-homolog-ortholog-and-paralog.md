Homolog

* A gene related to a second gene by descent from a common ancestral DNA sequence. The term, homolog, may apply to the relationship between genes separated **by the event of speciation (see ortholog) **or **to the relationship betwen genes separated by the event of genetic duplication (see paralog)**.

Ortholog

* Orthologs are genes in **different species** that **evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation**. Normally, orthologs retain the same function in the course of evolution. Identification of orthologs is critical for reliable prediction of gene function in newly sequenced genomes. (See also Paralogs.).

Speciation

* Speciation is the origin of a new species capable of making a living in a new way from the species from which it arose. As part of this process it has also aquired some barreir to genetic exchage with the parent species.

Paralog

* Paralogs are genes related by **duplication within a genome**. **Orthologs retain the same function in the course of evolution, whereas paralogs evolve new functions**, even if these are related to the original one.
