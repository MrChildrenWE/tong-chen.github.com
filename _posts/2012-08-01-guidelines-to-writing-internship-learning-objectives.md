Guidelines to Writing Internship Learning Objectives  
Internships provide students with an opportunity to put into practice skills they have  
learned while in school. In addition, students should have an opportunity to enhance  
those skills, obtain the perspective of a work environment and benefit from a mentor or  
supervisor’s experience and advice.  
To gain maximum benefit, the work experience must have a supervisor or mentor  
available to provide coaching and evaluation of the student. Before the internship begins,  
student and supervisor, with approval of an IT advisor, should develop several learning  
objectives to be met during the work experience.  
Objectives are views as outcomes. In other words, what do you expect to learn or  
experience during your internship. Objectives are not tactics. In other words, objectives  
are not a punch list of tasks to be performed. Tactics should be listed for each objective.  
Each tactic should advance the particular objective it supports.  
To begin writing Learning Objectives, first describe the job environment. You need to  
ascertain whether this environment will provide you with the opportunity and the means  
to enhance your skills and to contribute in a meaningful way. What is the name of the  
company? What does the company do? What department will you be working in? How  
does that department contribute to the company’s mission? Is there a supervisor/mentor  
available to guide your experience?  
Next, think about what you want to gain from this work experience. Do you want to  
learn new programming techniques? Do you want to discover new ways to enhance web  
pages? Do you want to understand what maintaining a database entails as users request  
changes or additions? Do you want to learn how this particular company implements a  
new product? Use this list to develop at least three Learning Objectives.  
Finally, list the specific tasks you will perform that lead to the accomplishment of each  
Learning Objective. List the contributions you will expect of your supervisor/mentor in  
guiding you in the performance of your tasks.  
Make sure your type your submission. Use the spell-checker.
