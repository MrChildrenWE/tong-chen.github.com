*   Monoallelic expression is an interesting epigenetic phenomenon, as it requires cells to treat the two alleles of a gene unequally, even though their sequences can be identical and they are present in the same nucleus.
*   Although monoallelic expression in the context of genomic imprinting is governed by marks placed during gametogenesis, for random monoallelic expression the determination of which allele will be expressed must be made by individual cells in the developing embryo. After a choice has been made, descendent cells maintain the choice.
*   It has been known for decades that the entire X chromosome in the cells of female placental mammals is subject to random monoallelic expression, but until recently autosomal examples were thought to be restricted to the immune system and chemosensory systems.
*   Genome-scale analyses have now uncovered an unexpectedly large number of autosomal genes that are subject to random monoallelic expression and have shown that these genes encode proteins with a wide range of functions.
*   A number of unusual mechanisms are known to be involved in the regulation of some of these genes, but for most monoallelically expressed genes the mechanisms remain to be defined.
*   Random monoallelic expression has the potential to affect the connection between genotype and phenotype and also has the potential to affect natural selection and the evolution of gene families.
