      Anyone motivated to enter the field of bioinformatics is unlikely to need a freshman-level introduction to biology, but this one is included for the sake of completeness. The faculty are stellar, and the course has recently been converted to modular form with interactive quizzes, problem sets, exams, and additional helpful features.

      This is a modern treatment of evolution and ecology but not one especially geared to <span style="color: #ff0000;">quantitative analysis</span>, so may be considered optional for students of bioinformatics. Still it is a valuable reminder that molecular biology is not all there is. Especially interesting is the coverage of evolutionary medicine, in which Prof. Stearns is a leading light.

      The continuation of the first-year Berkeley program, Biology 1B, spends a third of the course covering plant biology in more detail than is necessary for bioinformatics, but also provides a solid introduction to genetics and phylogeny that may be preferred as being more molecular (<a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/playlist#c,d,Biology,434C6A29FA3A4580" target="pmc_ext">http://webcast.berkeley.edu/playlist#c,d,Biology,434C6A29FA3A4580</a>).

With this video course we introduce a resource developed by the Indian National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL), whose ambition is “to build at least one version of each course offered in all of Science and Engineering in India, from BTech/BSc to PhD programs” (<a href="http://nptel.iitm.ac.in" target="pmc_ext">http://nptel.iitm.ac.in</a>). It currently offers some 110 full video courses, skewed toward engineering, but with plans for up to 400 total. The courses tend to follow very traditional syllabi and sometimes move slowly, but are generally well produced and exhaustive in their coverage. The lectures are delivered in English that is more or less accented but nearly always impeccable, and altogether make for a rather refreshing multicultural experience.

      This pair of courses together provide in-depth coverage of classical genetics through modern genomics of the non-human variety. The first course, entitled “Plant Molecular Genetics,” actually begins with a comprehensive introduction to general Mendelian genetics, before delving into plant genetics in detail. The student may wish to skip some of the latter lectures, but they do cover many aspects of molecular genetics that are completely general. The second entry, “Microbial Genetics and Genomics,” starts halfway through the actual course with the lectures of Prof. Glass, focusing on comparative genomics, and includes an extended exercise in annotation of a new microbial genome from the Joint Genome Institute. Finally, for some exposure to current human genetics, the student should take the “Genetics for Epidemiologists” short course conducted by the National Human Genome Research Institute in 2008 (<a role="button" href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6D747D95EBB33F2D" target="pmc_ext">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6D747D95EBB33F2D</a>). While this pastiche of sources may not be ideal, it touches on the major themes in this diverse subject and will give a good sense of the tools underlying many laboratory methods used in molecular biology.

In the functional genomics unit, we start with RNA expression dynamics, analysis of alternative splicing, epigenomics and ChIP-seq, and metagenomics. Model organisms and forward and reverse genetics screens are then discussed, along with quantitative trait locus (QTL) and eQTL analysis. After that, we introduce integrative and single cell genomics approaches and systems biology. Finally, we conclude by introducing … proteomic approaches.”

It will be closely based on the long-established core course in the Penn Graduate Group in Genomics and Computational Biology, and in fact the instructors plan to use the material with their own students. Prof. Hogenesch in particular has a strong computational orientation and indicates that the material taught in this course will be “bioinformatics-ready” (personal communication).

      Much of a biologist&#8217;s advanced training is down to departmental seminars, invited speakers, conferences, etc. This star-studded collection amassed by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute now has some 80 extended seminars covering a wide range of topics, including some that are underrepresented in the available online courseware, such as neurosciences and developmental biology.

        Bioinformatics students who have somehow only studied math through integral calculus may find that some knowledge of differential equations is an important addition to their skill set. Not only are differential equations a mainstay of mathematical biology in areas such as enzyme kinetics and population dynamics, but they are the basis of many approaches to modeling of biological systems. Prof. Mattuck&#8217;s development of the subject is fairly traditional, but is supplemented by updated “wrappers” in the MIT courseware that provide helpful visualizations and simulations of the sort to which many modern treatments of the subject are trending.

        Prof. Strang is a legend as an educator, charmingly diffident in his delivery yet never lacking in clarity. He has long held that the subject of linear algebra should be given as much or more teaching emphasis than calculus and differential equations, and the rise of <span style="color: #ff6600;">Big Data</span> is now proving him correct beyond any doubt. No bioinformatics professional dealing with high-dimensional data can afford to neglect an understanding of matrix math, with many bioinformatics methods currently making use of various matrix factorizations, transformations, decompositions, and eigenwhatevers.

        Only those with no exposure at all to statistics, or those who would benefit from a refresher, should feel the need to take this rather elementary introduction, but the skills are certainly essential to bioinformatics analysis. If necessary it can also provide a gentle lead-in to the Introduction to Probability course, which in turn will be required for more advanced work in statistics. The course makes use of the free statistical software package R (<a href="http://www.r-project.org" target="pmc_ext">http://www.r-project.org</a>), which bioinformatics practitioners should have in their toolbox not only for classical statistical tests taught here but for more advanced applications such as linear and nonlinear modeling, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.

        Bioinformatics methods depend on statistics to a much greater degree and in much greater depth than biologists typically encounter in their training for analysis of variance and experimental design. Consequently a solid foundation in probability is de rigeur, particularly in preparation for data mining and machine learning applications. Prof. Blitzstein has an unintimidating, even laid-back style, always striving to convey valuable intuitions, but does not lack in rigor or depth of coverage.

        Despite the name, this course also extends to formal language theory and introduces tractability. The primary attraction of this Coursera offering is its illustrious instructor, who literally wrote the book on automata (and on databases, on algorithms, etc.). It&#8217;s hard to imagine a better way for biologists to be introduced to the theory of computation. Topics such as automata and grammars are important in areas like pattern matching and RNA fold prediction, while an awareness of tractability and decidability is essential in contemplating algorithmic approaches to new problems. Perhaps most importantly, as Prof. Ullman points out, surveys of Stanford grads show that this course was one of the most useful in their subsequent careers, for the mindset it engendered in solving many real-world computational challenges.

        Although more narrowly focused than the preceding entry, many will prefer this course as an entry point to discrete math because it will be on Coursera. It should serve as good training for the mathematical mindset and rigor of the subject area in general, and relative to some other treatments of combinatorics it will have the advantage of being closely tied to algorithms. In addition, its textbook will be made freely available online <a role="button" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3441465/#pcbi.1002632-Flagolet1">[20]</a>.

        Optimization is a vast field, often associated with operations research or engineering disciplines but not seen as a core aspect of bioinformatics to date. Nevertheless applications can be found and are emerging in systems biology, modeling, experimental design, metabolic engineering, and now synthetic biology. This well-produced introductory course was actually taught by Purdue faculty in a summer program at Trinity College Dublin, the Network Mathematics Graduate Programme, along with several other courses listed in this curriculum. (Be sure to select the high resolution option on the video, and if the built-in player misbehaves simply download the MP4 files.)

        It goes without saying that much of molecular biology deals with the storage and transmission of information, which by itself makes information theory a proper topic of study for bioinformatics. Basic elements of the theory are important in machine learning approaches to data mining and appear frequently in bioinformatics tools and algorithms, including sequence motif analysis and many other applications.

        Traditional engineering approaches to signal processing and linear systems theory have not had a huge impact in bioinformatics to date, despite the fact that signal transduction and transmission are central aspects of cell biology. Still, some training in the engineering math that relates to feedback systems, filters, convolution, and the like is recommended as an elective, given trends in areas like systems biology and neuroinformatics. Nor should it be forgotten that Fourier analysis is at the foundation of crystallographic structure determination, and that signal processing is directly relevant to instrumentation used in omics and image processing, among other things. Although this course was recorded a quarter-century ago, it still feels very well put-together, and the eminent Prof. Oppenheim wrote the definitive text in the subject <a role="button" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3441465/#pcbi.1002632-Oppenheim1">[30]</a>.

        For biologists possessing only end-user experience with computers, several courses are available that offer a modest introduction to actual programming, generally in the context of an overview of computer science. This one is chosen somewhat arbitrarily, but in particular because it makes use of Python. While opinions about languages vary, a case can be made that Python is both well accepted in the bioinformatics community and pedagogically useful in encompassing many features (perhaps even too many) of object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming, in addition to ample libraries and bindings to other languages and resources. It is also a good compromise between a traditional Java or C++ language approach, which only serious bioinformatics developers will need, and the sort of lightweight scripting for string, file, and process manipulation (think Perl) that every analyst will do sooner or later. In addition, Python is simply easier to manage on a home laptop, a requirement for many online learners.

        The courses above offer taster menus of various aspects of computer science and only basic programming skills, and as such are appropriate for bioinformatics professionals who need exposure to programming but will not be doing it for a living. Those who plan to do coding in-the-large or create compute-intensive applications should start with the following three courses instead, which offer greater depth and breadth in programming principles. Those who would like to focus immediately on data-driven scientific computing could do worse than “<span style="color: #ff6600;">Advanced Scientific Computing with Python</span>” taught by Berkeley Astronomy Prof. Joshua Bloom (<a role="button" href="http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/astronomy-250-001-spring-2012/id497766986" target="pmc_ext">http://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/astronomy-250-001-spring-2012/id497766986</a>); this course is not particularly tied to astronomy (which is wrestling with Big Data from sky surveys rather than omics), and introduces packages ranging from statistics to visualization to parallel computing, although the resolution of the videos may lead to eye strain.

        This is the first in a cycle of three core courses that Berkeley requires of computer science majors; the other two follow below. It now teaches Python 3 (after many years of using Scheme, a LISP dialect and thus more purely functional) to get across the “big ideas” of programming, covering design principles, analysis of performance, confirmation of correctness, and management of complexity. As a matter of historical interest, the title and pedigree of this course traces back to the legendary MIT course 6.001, which for decades started many computer scientists and electrical engineers on their careers, and to the associated Scheme-based book (now available online <a role="button" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3441465/#pcbi.1002632-Abelson1">[33]</a>) by Profs.

        Stanford Engineering has long made available its own triad of core courses for CS majors, which are only very slightly showing their age. Stanford&#8217;s first course is “Programming Methodology,” which teaches Java by jumping in the deep end, paying a fair amount of attention along the way to good software engineering practice (<a href="http://see.stanford.edu/SEE/courseinfo.aspx?coll=824a47e1-135f-4508-a5aa-866adcae1111" target="pmc_ext">http://see.stanford.edu/SEE/courseinfo.aspx?coll=824a47e1-135f-4508-a5aa-866adcae1111</a>).

        Moving on from Python to Java, the Berkeley sequence not only lays out the standard toolbox of data structures but begins to sprinkle in more software engineering techniques, awareness of machine architecture, abstraction, and classic algorithms. Prof. Hilfinger, who teaches these first two courses, moves at a good clip and is unfailingly rigorous yet clear. For enterprise-wide bioinformatics programming Java is the language of choice, and the class text, “Head First Java” <a role="button" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3441465/#pcbi.1002632-Bates1">[34]</a>, is reputed to be one of the least painful ways to learn this (or any) language—high praise indeed.

Note that the Stanford series as a whole thus teaches the languages Java, then C++, and finally a bit of LISP, Python, etc., while the Berkeley series does Python, then Java, and then C. The latter ordering is probably more appropriate for bioinformatics.

Prof. Skiena&#8217;s background is algorithms and discrete math, and he uses the book “An Introduction to Bioinformatics Algorithms” by Neil Jones and Prof. Pavel Pevzner of the University of California at San Diego <a role="button" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3441465/#pcbi.1002632-Jones1">[37]</a>.

        Bioinformatics has a long tradition relating it to artificial intelligence (AI), including the origins of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference series. Besides introducing machine learning, which should be pursued further in the next course listed, this course introduces knowledge representation, important as a foundation for biological ontologies; Bayesian nets, useful in biological network causal analysis; and natural language understanding, which is highly relevant to biomedical text mining. The course uses Python, and refers to but does not require the very popular text by Berkeley Prof. Stuart Russell and Google&#8217;s Peter Norvig, “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach” <a role="button" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3441465/#pcbi.1002632-Russell1">[38]</a>.

        This course provides modest coverage of the topics in the Commentary, which may well lead the interested student to pursue additional elective courses below. Students interested in robotic technologies, for instance in control of laboratory automation, should consider Stanford Prof. Oussama Khatib&#8217;s course “Introduction to Robotics” (<a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=86cc8662-f6e4-43c3-a1be-b30d1d179743" target="pmc_ext">http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=86cc8662-f6e4-43c3-a1be-b30d1d179743</a>).

        Stanford Engineering offers a “Machine Learning” course by Prof. Andrew Ng, also available now on Coursera (which he co-founded). It is excellent in its own way and heavily overlaps the material in this one, though with less of a data mining focus and some attention paid to robotics (<a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=348ca38a-3a6d-4052-937d-cb017338d7b1" target="pmc_ext">http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=348ca38a-3a6d-4052-937d-cb017338d7b1</a>).

A very popular albeit advanced text, “<span style="color: #ff6600;">Elements of Statistical Learning</span>” by Stanford Profs.

HMMs are not covered in the core courses above (though they are introduced in the course below), nor are there the same sort of user-friendly environments for HMMs, but there are toolkits that the bioinformatics student can use to study the associated algorithms, such as <span style="color: #ff6600;">HMMoC</span> (<a href="http://biowiki.org/HMMoC" target="pmc_ext">http://biowiki.org/HMMoC</a>) or HMMConverter (<a href="http://people.cs.ubc.ca/%7Eirmtraud/hmmconverter" target="pmc_ext">http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~irmtraud/hmmconverter</a>), as well as R packages. Stanford Prof. Daphne Koller, the other academic co-founder of Coursera, is offering a course on “<span style="color: #ff6600;">Probabilistic Graphical Models</span>,” another important flavor of machine learning that includes Bayesian nets and Markov random fields, which already have had significant impact in n<span style="color: #ff6600;">etwork bioinformatics</span> (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm" target="pmc_ext">https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm</a>).

      <p id="__p284">
        Game theory has long been used in the study of evolutionary dynamics, an increasingly important field, and backward induction is a generalization of the same sort of dynamic programming used in biological sequence analysis, applied to such problems as choosing optimal strategies in sports. Game theory also bears on modeling and network theory. Scientists in any quantitative field probably ought to be familiar with such basic ideas as the prisoners&#8217; dilemma, Pareto optimality, and Nash equilibria, or indeed with any field that has produced eight Nobel prizes. The subject tends to be taught in economics departments, which makes for an interesting change of perspective, and also provides a link to the fascinating new field of neuroeconomics.

        Many students who learn bioinformatics will be exposed to the very latest advances in both biotechnology and computing, probably the two fields that result in the greatest rate of business startups, especially from academic spinoffs. Thus learning entrepreneurship skills is entirely appropriate as an elective in this curriculum. The STVP is housed in Stanford Engineering and hosted by the department of Management Science and Engineering. The web site has hundreds of videos, including seminars, case studies, and tutorials, many by Silicon Valley luminaries. As a way of organizing the student&#8217;s approach to this cornucopia, two collections in particular are recommended: “Invitation to Venture” (<a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/collections.html?collectionId=1" target="pmc_ext">http://ecorner.stanford.edu/collections.html?collectionId=1</a>) as an introduction, and then “Technology Ventures” (<a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/collections.html?collectionId=2" target="pmc_ext">http://ecorner.stanford.edu/collections.html?collectionId=2</a>) as a more directed approach of relevance to bioinformatics.

        At the inception of the Genome Project significant emphasis was placed on “ELSI” or ethical, legal, and social implications, and these are even more prominent today in such issues as personal data privacy, bioethics in human and animal experimentation, and the like. Biologists nowadays often have some training in bioethics but for computer scientists it may be more novel, yet increasingly important given new capacities for mining Big Data. This is a relatively short and very general introduction to ethics, but one that is highly intellectually stimulating—so much so that it fills a large theatre whenever it is presented at Harvard by Prof. Sandel, with production values worthy of a one-man show on Broadway. You are likely to discover useful things about yourself, for example, whether you are a deontologist or a consequentialist (which, for you computer types, has something to do with whether your moral judgments are determined at compile-time or run-time).

## Courses of Study {#s7title}

<p id="__p298">
  As noted at the outset, students will come to online learning from different backgrounds and with different goals in mind, and moreover will have different amounts of time to devote to the process. Therefore it is not helpful to be overly prescriptive about course selection. However, it is possible to identify some basic “types” of bioinformatics practitioners, and to suggest possible course selections best suited to those career paths. It should be emphasized that different institutions and individuals may have other views on bioinformatics curricula, disagreeing on appropriate electives and even on core courses. To this, the author can only plead editorial privilege, and remind the reader that these are opinions based on one person&#8217;s experience in the field. It would be prudent for potential students to seek a variety of opinions.
