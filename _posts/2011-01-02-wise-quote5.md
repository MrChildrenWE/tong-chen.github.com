when I was backpacking across Western Europe&#8230;

I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.

I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded.

And there were tall trees all around.

(Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous.

(Softly) And across the lake I saw&#8230;

a beautiful woman&#8230;

bathing herself&#8230;

but she was crying&#8230;
