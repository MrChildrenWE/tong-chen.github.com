### Research Interests

* For biology, my interest is in elucidating the mechanisms of the development of a life body to finally construct a model to simulate and predict ontogenesis.

* Besides, I am crazy about computational technologies and mining big data. For all the time, I want to dig into amounts of data to help constructing intelligent life.

### Research Experience

*     2009-2012	Exploring the function of protein internal repeats

        This is my first scientific project, focusing on protein
		internal repeats searching, classification and function
		prediction. Three years’ exploring strengthened my
		programming skills and the ability of applying bioinformatics
		tools, laid a solid foundation for future researches. I
		developed a Makefile based scripts management system and
		analysis pipeline, and latex based document auto-generation system.  

*    2012-2015	Genome-wide profiling of 5hmC in pluripotency stem cells and MEF
        
        I found 5hmC distribution preferred different cis-regulatory elements in embryonic stem cells and MEF, positively correlated with H3K36me3 profile and designed experiments to verify the regulatory relationship between H3K36me3 and 5hmC. I learned not only the principles of next generation sequencing and related bioinformatics analysis, but also a clear understanding and planning of research. 

*    2012-2015	Transcriptome-wide distribution of m6A in pluripotency and neural stem cells and somatic cells
       	
        I for the first time characterized the cell type specific and
		common m6A modification in cells with different pluripotency,
		found some new features of m6A distribution, predicted and
		verified that miRNAs can direct the m6A generation using a
		sequence-dependent manner for the first time.
		I formed my own research approaches, learned a lot in overall 
		planning and navigating a project, coordinating cooperation, 
		manuscript writing, submitting and negotiating.

*    2009-2015	Exploring the way for a meaningful life

        This is not a biological research project but a thinking of myself and my life. Five years of research makes me think about myself, know myself, discover myself and find my interests.
